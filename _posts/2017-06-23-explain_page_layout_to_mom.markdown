What is “Page Layout?”   I don’t think a formal definition has been provided so far in the Online class.  Wikipedia defines Page layout as “the part of graphic design that deals in the arrangement of visual elements on a page. It generally involves organizational principles of composition to achieve specific communication objectives.”  I would describe page layout simply as what you see on any web page of a website.

Now, I am really big on “user friendliness.”  Like everyone, I use software, apps, and websites on a daily basis, and I want to use programs that are easy to use.  A pet peeve of mine is having to search multiple pages and/or make multiple clicks to find a common piece of information like an address or phone number, which should be on the main page of a website.  As a future software developer, I am committed to focus on the end-user experience to make software that is very easy to use for anyone!
