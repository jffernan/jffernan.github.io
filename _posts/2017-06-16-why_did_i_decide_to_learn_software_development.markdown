I am making a career change in my mid-40s.  I am always looking for a new challenge to undertake.  I see working in the tech industry as a continual challenge because tech is always changing and evolving.  I am also a lifelong learner.  There seems to always be something new to learn in programming!  

I have no work experience in programming (although I have been using computers for over 30 years and about 20 years in work experience).  This past April, I found various free resources on learning to code via Google searches.  Since then, I have been learning at a couple "learn to code for free" websites like Code Academy as an introduction.  After deciding to make a career change, I researched several developer bootcamps, and found Flatiron's online program to be the best fit for me.

Why software development?  I love puzzles and solving them.  I find software to be one huge puzzle of code to play with, to solve, to understand, and to build.  So far learning to code in 2+ months has been a lot like learning how to speak a foreign language and learning how to ride a bike.  Learn the basics, apply, and learn by doing, doing, and doing through practice.  The repetition of doing and practice should make coding become routine and habit!  Programming languages also seem very logical like math, and I have a logical mind that wants to understand how software works.
